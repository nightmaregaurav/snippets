Fail2Ban: Fail2Ban is one of the best programs that is installed in every single Linux server I have EVER installed. This program is a intrusion prevention utility. Most install it, but forget to configure and use it. These are the settings I like to use.

Installing Fail2Ban: sudo apt install fail2ban

All configuration files are in /etc/fail2ban

Configuration file examples and defaults are in two main files /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.conf and /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf

/etc/fail2ban/jail.local:

[DEFAULT]
ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ::1
bantime = 3600
findtime = 600
maxretry = 5

[sshd]
enabled = true

Enabling Fail2Ban:
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
